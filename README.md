The RendererEvaluator was used to evaluate the funcitonality and performance of
the display server/composer also including the performance of native OpenGL driver stack.
For now, it's just only supported Android's SurfaceFligner. It was added in my TOOD list for
supporting the Ubuntu Touch's Mir display server in the future.

Under heavily developing status, more detailed description will be updated.
